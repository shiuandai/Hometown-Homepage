> The **Hometown Homepage** is my first static website which I introduce my hometown spots and the brief information to visitors who can review from and knowing more Taiwan culture. Welcome to contact me if you need a local tour guide.

I start the Scrimba Module 2 course- Web dev basics and learn how to use basic HTML & CSS knowledge. At the end of the course, I follow the Figma template to finish my hometown page where you can know more about me, take a look on the ‚Üí [My Hometown Homepage](https://shiuandai.github.io/Hometown-Homepage/).

## How I start the project?

* Ensure all points are taken into consideration from Figma Template. ‚Üí [Figma Template from Scrimba](https://www.figma.com/file/2QuGfAOcHaZJ6aHXfuamnK/Hometown-Homepage?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=JhG1UWTiUmIeW14l-1)
* Having a materials preparation document where I collect pictures/text information/text font/color to match a better visual communication and coherence in one page.
* It's important to brainstorm the HTML structure before starting coding, this step helps me save the time.
* Use the "DRY" concept (Don't Repeat Yourself), so that I learn from tailoring the developer's code and learn from it and Scrimba course.
* To show the completed work between a Web and a template, I prefer refining the CSS code to make sure the project can align the design.

## 1. - Design requirements

Designing a homwtown homepage website requires following some rules and taking into consideration that the project is not only a graphic project but a web project too. The next sections are crucial for any web project.

### 1.1 - Structure design

* [ ] **HTML** is "HyperText Markup Language" It defines the meaning and structure of web content. The Web Designer should keep the structure simple and the similar content chould be grouped together to make sure it can be read clearly.
	> ‚ÑπÔ∏è [HTML] GET to know more about the definition. ‚Üí [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)

* [ ] **Be familiar with the HTML** I‚Äôll be familar with the HTML by learning more its <tag>. 
* [ ] Before working on each website project, I can **build every templates** with my own strcutre concept. Building the structure before everything else, will facilitate my work afterwards.

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm">
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

‚ö†Ô∏è *Use the container to define which tags should be contained inside, they can be active when using the **flex-box**, it is a crucial method to foster the strcture building.*

### 1.2 - Colors

You can "SAVE" your color preference in your account. ‚Üí [Color Palette](https://scrimba.com/links/hometown-palette)

* [ ] **All colors used in the creatives are named** (RED: #E63946, LIGHT: #F1FAEE, AQUA: #A8DADC, LIGHT BLUE: #457B9D, DARK BLUE: #1D3557) which are provided by Scrimba course so that they become the basic color guideline to use in my project.

* [ ] All or the most important/used **colors contrast** in the design to allow text with the background can be easily read.

**[‚¨Ü back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### 1.3 - Fonts and texts

Fonts are an essential part of every design.

It is recommended to organise the font size and style in the design process. There are several website where the designer can download the font.([Google font](https://fonts.google.com/)).

* [ ] Using the technique **@font-face** in CSS, the link is embedded to the CSS. 

  __Resources:__
	* üìñ [Using @font-face | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/using-font-face/)

* [ ] The **Web Safe Fonts** is an important concept. Web safe fonts are fonts that are pre-installed by many operating systems. While not all systems have the same fonts installed, you can use a web safe font stack to choose several fonts that look similar, and are installed on the various systems that you want to support.

### 1.4 - Publish files

* [ ] How to host your website, there are several ways. 1. **Netlify** provides next-generation web hosting and automation that's very affordable. Is can be integrated with Github for publishing web easily. The alternative is using Github Page,my way is to use Github Page. ‚Üí [Comparison of Github Page and Netlify](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/publish-your-website-netlify-github/) 

## 2. - Pre-work phases

### 2.1 - Refine the project using CSS

It is recommended to master **flex-box** concept, it usually combine with different **Property** like **flex-direction: column; align-items: center;** .

Define what condition to use the flex-box, it influences on how the content display.

‚ö†Ô∏è *When use the flex-box, it is good to use property of "gap" rather than "margin".*

## 3. - Before production

Before launching your website, be sure to review all your code and make sure the text layout and comment it's easy to read.
